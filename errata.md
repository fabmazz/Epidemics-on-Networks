# Errata for [*Mathematics of Epidemics on Networks*](http://www.springer.com/book/9783319508047)

This errata is limited to errors that are significant enough to cause confusion.

If you believe you have found an error:
 - If it is a minor typo that won't cause confusion for others (e.g., obvious misspelling, inconsequential punctuation error), please report it [here](https://github.com/springer-math/Mathematics-of-Epidemics-on-Networks/issues/9).
 - If it is major enough that it should be on this page, please check if it is already on this list and if not open a new issue [here](https://github.com/springer-math/Mathematics-of-Epidemics-on-Networks/issues) (use the green "New Issue" button). 

## Dedication

- "\epsilon_2" should be "Matilda"

## Chapter 1 

- Figure 1.4(b) has an error.  The final size should be quite a bit below 1.

## Chapter 2 

- In Proposition 2.4, in equations for k=1,...,N-1, the value Y_2^0 should be interpreted as the same as Y^0 and Y_1^{N}  should be interpreted as the same as Y^N.

## Chapter 3

- In Equation 3.5(d), there should be an additional 2 terms:  +\gamma_i \<I_iS_j\> + \gamma_j \<S_iI_j\>

## Chapter 4

 - In Figure 4.7c: \tau is actually 1.1\tau_c, not 1.2\tau_c

 - In Figure 4.11: \tau is not 2\tau_c.  It is actually 1.5 \tau_c = 1.5 \gamma/ \<K\>  (the factor of
2 should be 1.5)

## Chapter 5 
- In Figure 5.2c the label 1.2\tau should be 1.1\tau.

## Chapter 6 

- In Figure 6.7, it was not made clear that the percolation is performed by taking a single network for each N, giving each edge a weight uniformly in (0,1) and then as $p$ decreases from $1$, removing an edge when $p$ crosses its weight.

- equation 6.8a, \xi should be \zeta.

- In the displayed equation for example 6.3 \xi should be \zeta

- In Theorem 6.17, |H_{IN}]|+|H_{OUT}| in the right-hand side of the
upper equation (for epidemic probability) should be |H_{IN}]|+|H_{SCC}|.

## Chapter 7

- On page 255, the last paragraph of the introduction should note that the (PW) model is system (5.15), the ED model is system (5.38) and the EBCM model is system (6.12).
